Hi, I'm Ron Glozman ðŸ‘‹, a 17-year-old high school student passionate about Cyber Security. I enjoy solving CTFs in my free time, and this site is where I'll be sharing my write-ups for the CTFs I solve, with my main categories being pwn and reverse for the moment. I'm also constantly working on a variety of projects; you can check out my portfolio of projects [here](../Projects).
